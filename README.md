## Abstract
I tried intuitive visualizations of important concepts introduced
in "Linear Algebra for Everyone".

This is aimed at promoting understanding of vector/matrix calculations
and algorithms from the perspectives of matrix factorizations.
They include Column-Row (CR), Gaussian Elimination (LU),
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization (QR), Eigenvalues and Diagonalization (Q Lambda Q^T),
and Singular Value Decomposition (U Sigma V^T).
