## Abstract
I tried intuitive visualizations of important concepts introduced
in ``Linear Algebra for Everyone".
This is aimed at promoting understanding of vector/matrix calculations
and algorithms from the\linebreak perspectives of matrix factorizations.
They include Column-Row ($\bm{CR}$), Gaussian Elimination ($\bm{LU}$),
Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization ($\bm{QR}$), Eigenvalues and Diagonalization ($\bm{Q \Lambda Q^\mathbf{T}}$),
and Singular Value Decomposition ($\bm{U \Sigma V^\mathbf{T}}$).
